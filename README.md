# Introduction

This package provides an alternative implementation of R-package
`simrel`. This packages is more functional in its approach where the big
function in the pacakge `simrel` is splitted into smaller function. This
way, the logic behind the simulation are more transparant and easy to
understand, maintain and test.

Currently, this package has not implemented the bivariate simulation
which is in the `simrel` package. This will be implemented in subsequent
updates which will also adds additional utilities functions and plotting
functions.
