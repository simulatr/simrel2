# Introduction

This package provides an alternative implementation of R-package `simrel`. This packages is more functional in its approach where the big function in the pacakge `simrel` is splitted into smaller function. This way, the logic behind the simulation are more transparant and easy to understand, maintain and test.

Currently, this package has not implemented the bivariate simulation which is in the `simrel` package. This will be implemented in subsequent updates which will also adds additional utilities functions and plotting functions.
